	<p>
	  Carter Westwood is a 25 year old investment banker at the TD building.
	  He works long days (9 am - 10 pm) Monday to Friday. 
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  He walks/transits to work and lives a fast paced life as he's, 
	  "here for a good time, not a long time". Also, he's always looking to 
	  make the big score and impress his bosses in order to get
	  that big bonus. At work, he's always interacting with multiple 
	  accounts and devices while managing a lot of work related applications.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  When he has time, he's playing hockey, attending the next big
	  rave or out partying with friends. Because of this, he also uses
	  a lot of social media platforms to keep in touch with people. At the same time,
	  he uses social media to see trends on the market.
